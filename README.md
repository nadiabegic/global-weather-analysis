# Objective:
This repository was commissioned by the Office of Quirky Inquiries (OQI) to answer the following research question:

_"Is London really as rainy as the movies make it out to be?"_

# Statement of Need:


# Methodology:
- (FIX THIS LATER - DRAFT)
- obtain longitude and latitude of ten different cities; explain why i chose ten different cities including london, 3 rainy, 3 moderate, 3 dry, and then rank the cities from 1-10 to see how rainy it is relative to other cities 
    - obtain the number of days of rainfall in 2023
    - average precipitation in 2023
- was london perhaps rainier before and that's why we believe it to be so wet?
    - obtain average number of days of rainfall over 20 year period - why did i choose 20 years?
    - average precipitation over 20 year period 
- box plot, standard deviation from mean which will reveal is london weather just really unpredictable 

Chosen cities:
- London
- Edinburgh 
- Sarajevo
- Paris
- Madrid 
- New York
- Dubai
- Los Angeles
