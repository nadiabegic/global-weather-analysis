# Objective:
This repository was commissioned by the Office of Quirky Inquiries (OQI) to answer the following research question:

_"Is London really as rainy as the movies make it out to be?"_

# Statement of Need:
The question of the extent of London's 'raininess' is crucial to answer, as Londoners have been enabled to complain about their weather for far too long. The answer to this perplexing question warrants deeper investigation than simply the annual precipitation that London faces compared to other cities; there are various factors that contribute to one's perception of 'raininess'. This repository was developed to assess the factors of annual precipitation, number of days of rain, and duration of sunshine in 2023. However, it is also important to consider the impact of time and climate change on rainfall, and we should consider that perhaps London was indeed a much rainier city twenty years ago. 

# Methodology:
- (FIX THIS LATER - DRAFT)
- obtain longitude and latitude of ten different cities; explain why i chose ten different cities including london, 3 rainy, 3 moderate, 3 dry, and then rank the cities from 1-10 to see how rainy it is relative to other cities 
    - obtain the number of days of rainfall in 2023
    - average precipitation in 2023
- was london perhaps rainier before and that's why we believe it to be so wet?
    - obtain average number of days of rainfall 20 years ago - why did i choose 20 years?
    - average precipitation 20 years ago
- box plot, standard deviation from mean which will reveal is london weather just really unpredictable 

Chosen cities:
- London
- Edinburgh 
- Sarajevo
- Paris
- Madrid 
- New York
- Dubai
- Los Angeles
- Damascus
- Amsterdam

# Implementation and usage:
A user will need to download the world_cities.csv which can be found on the [joelacus/world-cities](https://github.com/joelacus/world-cities/blob/main/world_cities.csv) repository.
